MVP Project Proposal:  
Whiz is a web application that provides users with information on public restrooms in their chosen area. When users input a location, an interactive map will display available facilities.

When users hover over a location, a custom popup will display basic location information and rating. Once user clicks on a facility,they will be directed to a page with more detailed information such as accessibility, cleanliness rating, pictures, hours, address, etc.  

Whiz will use Google Maps API and user ratings to supply information. This will provide users with multiple options enabling users to choose the facilities(s) that fit their specific needs.

Icebox:
1. User will see list of facilities in order of rating
1. Creating an account would allow user to save their favorite locations
1. Algorithm for flagging reviews entered

Sketch of Final Product:
1. Landing page will display name of web application, description of website, and input form for location information
1. After inputting location, user will be taken to another page with a map. The map will contain pins of locations
1. Once user clicks on pin (to request more information), user will be taken to location specific information. This page will allow user to enter reviews.
